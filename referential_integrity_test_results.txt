🧪 REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY TEST RESULTS
======================================
Test Suite: StepsController Referential Integrity with ProcessorId
Execution Time: 2024-12-19 10:40:00 UTC
Purpose: Verify 409 Conflict protection after ProcessorId migration

🔧 SETUP: Creating prerequisite entities
========================================
✅ Created Schema entities for ProcessorEntity
✅ Created ProcessorEntity with ProcessorId: 987fcdeb-51a2-43d1-b456-426614174999
✅ Created StepEntity with ProcessorId reference: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174001

🔧 SETUP: Creating referencing entities  
========================================
✅ Created FlowEntity referencing step in StepIds
✅ Created AssignmentEntity referencing step as StepId

🧪 TESTING: 409 Conflict on DELETE
==================================
Test: DELETE step with references (409 Conflict)
✅ PASS - Status: 409

Referential Integrity Response Details:
{
  "error": "Cannot delete StepEntity. Referenced by: FlowEntity (1 records), AssignmentEntity (1 records)",
  "details": "Cannot modify StepEntity. Found 1 FlowEntity reference.",
  "referencingEntities": {
    "flowEntityCount": 1,
    "assignmentEntityCount": 1,
    "totalReferences": 2,
    "entityTypes": [
      "FlowEntity (1 records)",
      "AssignmentEntity (1 records)"
    ]
  }
}

🧪 TESTING: 409 Conflict on UPDATE
==================================
Test: UPDATE step with references (409 Conflict)
✅ PASS - Status: 409

Referential Integrity Response Details:
{
  "error": "Cannot delete StepEntity. Referenced by: FlowEntity (1 records), AssignmentEntity (1 records)",
  "details": "Cannot modify StepEntity. Found 1 FlowEntity reference.",
  "referencingEntities": {
    "flowEntityCount": 1,
    "assignmentEntityCount": 1,
    "totalReferences": 2,
    "entityTypes": [
      "FlowEntity (1 records)",
      "AssignmentEntity (1 records)"
    ]
  }
}

🔧 CLEANUP: Removing referencing entities
=========================================
✅ Deleted FlowEntity: dfb25ddf-1cbc-4667-875c-12fb4ba92223
✅ Deleted AssignmentEntity: f91a06f2-5d31-45d5-ae6a-d8f562631914

🧪 TESTING: 204 No Content after cleanup
========================================
Test: DELETE step after removing references (204 No Content)
✅ PASS - Status: 204
